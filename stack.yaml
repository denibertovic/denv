# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
# resolver: ghcjs-0.1.0_ghc-7.10.2
# resolver:
#  name: custom-snapshot
#  location: "./custom-snapshot.yaml"
resolver: lts-18.28


# A package marked 'extra-dep: true' will only be built if demanded by a
# non-dependency (i.e. a user package), and its test suites and benchmarks
# will not be run. This is useful for tweaking upstream packages.
packages:
- .

# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver
# (e.g., acme-missiles-0.3)
